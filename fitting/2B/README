NOTE: USE PYTHON 3

First thing to do is to modify the top part of the python script 
with the proper information of your system. Everything that needs
to be changed is after In[6] and before In[7].

- Define the numebr of atoms of your system, for monomers 1 and 2
  nat1 and nat2
- Define the number of sites (water has 4 sites)
  nsites1 and nsites2
- If monomer 1 is water, set is_w = 1
  If monomer 2 is water, set is_w = 2
  Else, set is_w = 0
- Define the excluded pairs of your system for monomer 1 (exclXX_a)
  and monomer 2 (exclXX_b) as a python list of lists. If you don't 
  know how to use a python list, you google it.
- Define the charges, pols and polfacs for the real atoms for
  monomer 1 (chg_a, pol_a and polfac_a) and monomer 2 (chg_b, pol_b
  and polfac_b) AS STRINGS.
- Define the ks and ds min and max for inter and intramolecular 
  distances AS STRINGS.
- Define the C6 and D6 you obtained for TTM-nrg as a list of strings.
- Define the degree (degree), number of variables (nvars) and number 
  of terms (npoly) in your polynomials. This should be in the log of 
  the poly generation.
- Define which kind of variable you want to use for the intramolecular
  distances (var_intra), intermolecular distances (var_inter) and lone
  pair interactions (also inter, but is set in var_lp). There are two 
  options:
    - exp is the exponential exp(-k(d - d0))
    - coul is the  coulombic exp(-k(d - d0)/d)
- Define your DE (E_range). 
- Define which of the atoms in your input are virtual. As an example, 
  the monomer for water A1B2Z2 has Z as virtual (is a lone pair). Thus,
  vsites = ['Z']

Do not touch anything else.

To generate the fitting code, execute getcode.sh and follow 
instructions. If it doesn't work, breathe deep 3 times, meditate 
for 5 minutes, and read the instructions again. Then find the error
and try again.

This should generate a folder that contains fit-2b and eval-2b, which
as the names indicate, one fits and one evaluates.

==== TESTING ====
To run the test, just execute the script run_test_A1B2_A1B2.sh
