##PB: Needs to be updated 

# To compile the code :
1. Go to src/ 

2. Modify the \#define cards in fit-x3b-h2o-ion.cpp and ion.cpp for your system (ION?(FLUORIDE, CHLORIDE, BROMIDE, IODIDE))

3. Then do: 
$ make 

This creates two executables in ../bin/ fit* and eval-pot

Note: There is a Makefile for tscc as well in src/. To use it do "make -f Makefile.tscc" instead of "make" in src/. 

To run the codes, go to ../bin/

$ fit-x3b-h2o-ion-v1 x h2oh2ox-training-set.xyz 
where, x is to use the default initial guesses for the non-linear parameters. There are 3 different default initial guesses implemented in src/fit-x3b-h2o-ion-v1.cpp, use "x", "a" or "b".
       h2oh2ox-training-set.xyz must contain the configurations in xyz format, with energies in the comment line in this order: ThreeBodyEnergy   BindingEnergy  
The final fit parameters will be in fit-x3b-h2o-ion-v1.cdl 

$ eval-pot fit.nc h2oh2ox.xyz 
This returns the 3B energy from the fit in "fit.nc" 
To get fit.nc do : ncgen -o fit.nc fit-x3b-h2o-ion-v1.cdl
		where, fit-x3b-h2o-ion-v1.cdl is the output from the fitting code.
